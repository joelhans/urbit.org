There are a few ways to get your own planet:

- Getting an invitation from a friend (or stranger).
- Purchasing a planet, including hosting, from a [hosting provider](#hosting-providers).
- Manually setting up and hosting a planet purchased from a third party such as [azimuth.shop](https://azimuth.shop/), [urbit.live](https://urbit.live), [urbit.me](https://urbit.me), [Urbitex](https://urbitex.io), [Urbit Marketplace](https://urbitmarketplace.com/), or [Wexpert Systems](https://wexpert.systems).

## Hosting Providers {#hosting-providers}

Hosting providers will often sell you a planet and run it for you. This option is very simple but will probably cost a regular fee.

Urbit is designed to be portable. This means that if you sign up for hosting now but later want to leave your hosting provider and run your Urbit yourself, you should be able to work with them to obtain all of your data and boot your planet back up without losing anything.

Using hosting does mean that you're trusting your provider with your data, but so long as you have your planet, you'll always own your identity.

Current hosting providers are:

- [UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com)
- [escape pod store](https://www.escapepod.store/)
- [Third Earth](https://third.earth/)
- [Tlon Corporation](https://tlon.io)
